# OSM Settlements

Parse the OSM planet.osm to get a list of settlements with their coordinates. We define settlements as the nodes tagged as a 'city', a 'town' or a 'village'. See the [OSM Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:place) for more information about the *place* tag. 

## Dependencies

* Python 2.7
* lxml
* bz2file

## Use

### Parse the planet.osm

Open your console, go to the directory where you cloned the repository and type

```
make 
```

This will download the current planet.osm file, parse it to find all nodes
marked as a city, a town or a village and their coordinates, and save as a csv
file.

Once the data extracted and **transfered to another folder** type 

```
make clean
``` 

to delete **all** data (goes back to the initial state).

### Parse other osm files

If you want to parse any OSM file (planet, extract) already on your hard drive,
go to the directory where you cloned the repository and type

```
python parse.py /path/to/extract.osm.bz2 (/path/to/extracted/data)
```

if not specified, the data will be extracted in a new 'extr' directory.

## How long does it take?

Testing, will let you know as soon as it is done parsing :)
