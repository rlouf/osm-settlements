# OSM Locations

Parse the OSM planet.osm to get a list of cities with their coordinates.

## Use

In the directory, type 'make' in your console. This will download the current
planet.osm file, parse it to find all nodes marked as a city, a town or a
village and their coordinates, and save as a csv file.

Type 'make clean' to delete the data (downloaded and extracted).
